**Lim, T.H.** South Korean Election Campaign Booklet and Party Statements Corpora. 2025. _Sci Data_ **12**, 1030. [https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-05220-4](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-025-05220-4)

This descriptor presents two comprehensive text datasets from South Korean politics: the South Korean Election Campaign Booklet Corpus and the South Korean Party Statements Corpus. The Election Campaign Booklet Corpus comprises manifesto booklets from 49,678 individual candidates who ran for offices in single-member or multi-member districts during six National Assembly elections, six local elections, and five presidential elections in South Korea between 2000 and 2022. The Party Statements Corpus contains 82,723 official statements released by the two major political parties in South Korea from 2003 to 2022. As primary sources of political communication—the campaign materials used by individual candidates (Election Campaign Booklet Corpus) and the official communications from party leadership (Party Statements Corpus)—these datasets provide a novel opportunity for researchers to analyze inter-party and intra-party variations in political communication, political agendas, and policy positions in South Korea during the twenty-first century. Furthermore, these datasets can contribute to comparative studies in political science and communication studies by offering insights into the dynamics of election campaigning and agenda setting in a democratic context.

The dataset is publicly available on the [Open Science Framework (OSF) repository under the title "South Korean Election Campaign Booklet Corpus and Party Statements Corpus"](https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/RCT9Y).
