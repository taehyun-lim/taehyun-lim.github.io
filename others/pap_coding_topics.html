                    <button type="button" class="collapsible">1. Observations are coded according to the single predominant, substantive policy area rather than the targets of particular policies or the policy instrument utilized.</button>
                
                        <div class="subtopic-content">
                            <p>For example, if a case discusses mental health programs for returning veterans it would be coded according to the predominant substantive policy area (mental illness, code 333) rather than the target of the programs (veterans affairs, code 1609). If a case discusses changes to the home mortgage tax deduction, it is coded according to the substantive policy area (consumer mortgages, code 1504) rather than the policy instrument (the tax code, code 107).  </p>
                        </div>
                    
                    <button type="button" class="collapsible">2. Observations that discuss appropriations for particular departments and agencies are coded according to their substantive policy area. Those that discuss appropriations for multiple departments and agencies that span multiple major topic codes are coded as general government operations (code 2000). Budget and continuing resolutions, where Congress decides how much spending to allocate to each appropriations bill, should be coded as 105. </button>
                
                        <div class="subtopic-content">
                            <p>For example, cases that discuss appropriations for the Dept. of Energy are coded as energy (code 800) and those that discuss appropriations for the FAA are coded as air transportation (code 1003). Cases that discuss appropriations across multiple major topic areas, such as appropriations for the Dept. of State (code 1900), the Dept. of Defense (code 1600), and the Dept. of Energy (code 800), are coded as general government operations (code 2000).  </p>
                        </div>
                    
                    <button type="button" class="collapsible">3. Observations that discuss terrorism and homeland security issues are coded according to their substantive policy focus.</button>
                
                        <div class="subtopic-content">
                            <p>Since 2001, the U.S. government has revised its nomenclature for many government activities, often associated with the creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Because we are sensitive to the historical consistency of our category system going back to 1947, this has required some adjustments. As a result, and according to the first guideline above, cases discussing terrorism and homeland security are coded according to the particular substantive aspect of terrorism or homeland security at issue. For example, if an observation discusses a terrorist act outside of the United States by a foreign entity, it will coded as international terrorism (code 1927), while an observation that discusses strengthening airline security will be coded as air transportation (1003). Further, a case that discusses the protection of citizens from bioterrorist attacks with public health dimensions will be coded as health promotion (code 331), a case that discusses the prevention of terrorist attacks on crops or farm animals will be coded as animal and crop protection (code 405), and a case that discusses the prevention of terrorist attacks on nuclear energy facilities will be coded as nuclear energy (code 801). Observations dealing with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) budget requests, appropriations and other broad or cross-cutting issues involving DHS are coded as Civil Defense and Homeland Security Functions (code 1615), which includes general domestic terrorism prevention efforts.  </p>
                        </div>
                    
                    <button type="button" class="collapsible">4. Observations that discuss Native American affairs (code 2102), D.C. affairs (2014), or the affairs of U.S. Dependencies and Territories (code 2105) are placed in their corresponding subtopic codes regardless of substantive policy area. This is an exception to the first guideline.</button>
                
                        <div class="subtopic-content">
                            <p>  For example, a case that discusses restrictions on firearms in D.C. are coded as D.C. affairs (code 2014) rather than weapons control (code 1209).  </p>
                        </div>
                    
                    <button type="button" class="collapsible">5. Observations that mention foreign countries are coded according to the following sub-guidelines.</button>
                
                        <div class="subtopic-content">
                            <p>a. Observations that discuss U.S.-focused implications related to the policy of a foreign country are coded according to the substantive policy area. For example, if a case discusses the implications of a country’s CO 2 emissions policy on U.S. domestic climate change policy, it is coded as global warming (code 705).</p>  
                            <p>b. Observations that discuss the U.S. and another country in a dyadic relationship are generally coded within “Foreign Trade,” “Foreign Affairs,” or “Defense” depending on the substantive policy focus. General U.S. foreign policy issues are coded as foreign affairs (code 1900) and non-specific bilateral agreements are coded according to the country mentioned (code 1910 or 1921).</p>
                            <p>c. Observations not mentioning the U.S. are coded according to substantive policy area within Foreign Affairs. For example, if a case discusses violations of human rights in a specific country it is coded as human rights (code 1925). Remaining cases without a substantive policy focus are coded according to the region or specific country mentioned. These include cases discussing the entry of a new country into the E.U. (code 1910), the tax system of another country (code 1910 or 1921), or political developments in another country (code 1910 or 1921).  </p>
                        </div>
                    
                    <button type="button" class="collapsible">6. The “general” (NN00) subtopic includes cases where more than one distinct subtopic was discussed within a single major topic area.</button>
                
                        <div class="subtopic-content">
                            <p>For example, if a case discusses both water pollution (code 701) and air pollution (code 705), it is coded as a general environmental issue (code 700). Thus, the general category within each major topic area includes some cases that are truly general as well as some cases that are the combination of as few as two subtopics. Each major topic includes an “other” category (NN99) for issues that do not fit into any of the categories and for which there were too few cases to justify the creation of a new category.  </p>
                        </div>
                    
                    <button type="button" class="collapsible">7. While it is uncommon that observations not related to appropriations equally span two major topic areas, these observations are assigned the numerically lower major or subtopic code.</button>
                
                        <div class="subtopic-content">
                            <p>For example, a case that discussed both drinking water safety (code 701) and hydroelectricity (code 802) with equal weight is coded according to the numerically lower code (code 701). This is a rarely used, arbitrary guideline employed for cases that do not clearly have a distinguishable, predominate substantive issue focus.  </p>
                        </div>
                    
                    <button type="button" class="collapsible">8. Observations discussing health care policy are coded according to the following guideline:</button>
                
                        <div class="subtopic-content">
                            <p> Observations related to broad reforms to the health care system spanning multiple subtopics should be coded as comprehensive health care reform (code 301). </p>
                            <p> Observations related to individual reforms (e.g. drug pricing reforms) should be coded in the appropriate subtopic.  </p>
                            <p> Combinations of subtopics, where multiple topics are considered, but not as a packaged reform, should be coded as 300. Thus, a hearing described as, “To examine proposals to change to a single-payer system” would be coded as 301, as it is comprehensive and spans multiple sub-topics. A hearing described as, “To examine a proposal to lower the Medicare retirement age to 55” would be coded as 302 for health insurance. A hearing described as “A hearing to examine emerging problems in health insurance, hospitals and drug prices,” would be coded as 300, for combinations of subtopics. </p>
